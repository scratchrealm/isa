/*
    This file provides an element that collects Canvases into the same layout space. (Note, though,
    that dimensions of the Canvas elements are set externally--because they're passed in, not
    managed here--so nothing guarantees that the canvas elements will all actually overlap exactly
    with the div, if you chose to give them different widths/heights.)
    This allows drawing windows that use multiple canvases to avoid writing some boilerplate code.
    It also encapsulates the ability to turn off interactivity, by using a 'disableHandlers'
    parameter to control whether to conditionally render the list of event handlers.
    If you have a specific use case that requires disabling some event handlers but not others,
    that's' beyond the scope of this solution as currently written--you'd need to write
    some additional code for it.
