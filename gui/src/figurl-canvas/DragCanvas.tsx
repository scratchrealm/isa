/*
    This section handles event management, allowing the DragCanvas component to function
    with minimal requirements for the operational React component that makes use of the
    DragCanvas to overlay on one of its own Canvas elements. (I refer to the component that
    has an instance of this one as the "Patron" component.)

    We do not want to attach instance methods or store state in a particular
    DragCanvas instance, because the Patron component may need to make decisions based on
    the drag state (like styling Patron-level entities based on whether they fall
    within the current drag rect). Moreover, we want state updates to be atomic at the Patron
    component level (i.e. the Patron component should have a single State and maintain this
    via a reducer, rather than using setState() for a separate DragState state variable,
    since a separate useState() can cause race conditions & loops when the Patron rerenders.)

    The solution is for the Patron component to delegate part of its state to
    the DragCanvas for management. The DragState definition exposes three
    top-level functions that handle Drag-relevant events. They are implemented as pure
    functions (not being attached to a particular DragCanvas instance) which communicate with
    the Patron through the delegated state and call its reducer when needed.

    The exposed functions handle mouse movement, mouseup, and mousedown events. The Patron must
    listen for these events and call the handlers when needed. The handlers debounce the drag
    state (i.e. limit the rate at which changes to DragState are made) with no further input from
    the Patron. The mousedown and mouseup event handlers always do something, so those return void;
    but the mousemove event handler returns true if there was an active drag state being updated,
    and false if there is no active drag (i.e. mouse movement without any ongoing drag). This allows
    the Patron the option of taking action to respond to mouse movement events conditionally
    based on whether there's an active drag state (e.g. not applying a hover highlight if the user
    is dragging).

    Because Patron reducer logic varies and may be informed by Patron state, these functions
    also take a set of additional parameters which will be passed to the reducer. The contract for
    these handlers is that they will call the Patron reducer using the received state values,
    adding a DragAction appropriate to the managed drag state.

    NOTE: As currently designed, the Patron reducer MUST CALL THE DRAGREDUCER defined in DragCanvas.
    DragCanvas handles *requesting* updates, but can't handle the logic of determining the new
    drag state without the context of the rest of the Patron state.
